✅ **Add a `/scripts/` Folder**
- Place `.sql` files here with your schema, sample data inserts, and analysis queries.
- Example files:
  - `01_create_tables.sql`
  - `02_insert_sample_data.sql`
  - `03_analysis_queries.sql`

---

✅ **Use Issues & Projects**
- Open GitHub Issues for tasks (e.g., “Add attendance analysis query”).
- Use the Projects tab to track your to-dos, if you prefer a Kanban board.

---

✅ **Next Steps**
- Upload your SQL scripts.
- Add a license (MIT/BSD/etc.) if you plan to share publicly.
- Share your repo link on your resume or LinkedIn.
